I want to get the new honda type-r but im reading there are some transmission issues with grinding gears between change 1 and 2. There is also some shift lock out between 4 and 5. Gato advised that changing the clutch master cylinder with one moded by k20z3allmotorftw@gmail.com(IG:K20Z3allmotor) works and is much better for his car. It uses an oem clutch master cylinder that comes from Honda. This guy removes the damper that slows the clutching coming in and out.
